                <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                    <p> Our mission is to construct a website that offers products that are categorized as COVID-19 pandemic essentials 
                        effiently while adding some fashion to it. While there are many businesseses or e-commerce web apps that provide 
                        those essentials, it is hard to find one that is fashionable. For example, all the PPP blue masks might not look 
                        great on an individual’s outfit, or it looks out of match for the color pattern they are wearing. With our website, 
                        we aim to expand the market to the fashion industry. Besides that, we want to provide a collection of products and 
                        services that contribute in solving the products distribution issue during the pandemic, as well as in helping our
                        customers to create their fashion statements for the new trend that will occur due to the world problem. 
                        The products that we develop will be suitable for all age groups, as we want to be inclusive and allows everyone
                        to be a part of the fun no matter who they are. From masks to face shields and hand sanitizer, everything 
                        is crafted from the most high quality materials in the market. High quality products at an affordable price and
                        asy accessibility is what we strive to provide with our business. The customers will be able to see our goal from 
                        the moment they enter our welcome page until they buy and receive the products we sell. Finally, we hopd our app 
                        can bring the stress of looking for COVID essential products to a halt by giving our customers the joy of shopping
                        at our online store. <br><br>
                        As this project is a final project for our CPI310 Web-Based Information Management System class in Arizona State 
                        University, we are planning to finish it by the end of Fall2020 semester, or within seven weeks. The deliverables 
                        of this project will include back-end and front-end elements of the website that allow users to do a full transaction 
                        on our web app. Finally, our team is composed of four informatics students and one digital culture student where we 
                        divide our roles as front-end developers, back-end developers, a database administrator, and a project manager.

                    <h3>Purpose of Project (Motivations)</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce website that provides a platform for people 
                        to buy and sell COVID essentials easily. Since 2020 has been a tough year for everyone, our team wants 
                        to easen the tasks that people have to do due to the pandemic by bringing safety and style at the same time. 
                        Our project aims to encourage people to keep each other safe by providing products that are crucial during 
                        the pandemic while adding some fun and aestheticity to it. We expect our products to motivate our customers 
                        to show off their looks and care for the others' health simultaneously. The brand COVIDLY-Safe is creted to share 
                        the sense of a caring community, and our target market will be everyone affected by the pandemic. 
                        Safety and social distancing are critical during a pandemic, and we want everyone to be able to prioritize them 
                        whenever and wherever. For instance, we will provide fashionable products for the four different seasons: spring, 
                        summer, fall, and winter. No matter what the situations are, we want to see people caring for each other well by 
                        providing them with the tools or essentials that they need to be able to do so.

                    <h3> List of Deliverables </h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Front-End:</b> The User Interface is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, and Bootstrap. 
                        We decided to use the React framework to help us in organizing the modules and components on the 
                        website. Besides that, we are using jQuery and Bootstrap to help us in creating the design effectively and 
                        efficiently. By using Bootstrap, we can save time to create more components on our website while 
                        making sure our design can provide a good user experience. Some pages that will be in the deliverables 
                        are:

                        <b>Back-End:</b> We are using Node JS, Express JS, and SQLite to create the back-end side of the web 
                        application. Node JS and Express JS improves the scalability and the performance, while SQLite provides 
                        a fast and reliable data service for our application. Functionalities that will be included in the 
                        service side are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adding, updating, and deleting products from the cart for buyers</li>
                            <li>Adding, updating, and deleting products from the shop listing for sellers</li>
                            <li>Sending a message to admins on the “Contact Us” page</li>

                     <h3>Use Case analysis</h3>
                     <p>
                       <img src="assets/imgs/usecase.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Use Case Diagram">
                        Our use case diagram utilizes a relationship between customers and admins or the web app 
                        providers. The customer role includes the buyers and the re-sellers or those who sell their 
                        own products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The customer can sell their product, but the product must be checked by the admin first. 
                        The seller then will fill out a form and give the amount of time the product will be shipped. 
                        The admin will decide if the product is considered a COVID essential product. 
                        If the admin deems it to be a product that does not fit the business' purpose, then the admin 
                        will send a message to the customer saying, “I am sorry, but your product is not COVIDLY-Safe”.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        When the customer is shopping, they can add products to their cart or delete them from their cart. 
                        Once the customer is done shopping, they can click on the cart icon and review the products in 
                        their cart. Then they can proceed to checkout and create a transaction for the products. 
                        The customer will choose how to pay their products online, such as by PayPal, a credit card or 
                        a debit card, a gift card, or a check. The admin will calculate the tax for the transaction. 
                        After the customer go through the checkout process, then the products will be shipped to their address.
                    </p>

                        <img src="assets/imgs/datadesign.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Database Design">
                        For the database design the web app needs to record the Customers, Products, Orders, and Order Details. 
                        In the Customers' database, the data that will be recorded are their full name, date of birth,  location, 
                        email, username, and password. The data will be gathered when the customer creates their account to 
                        purchase or sell products on the app. The data or information in the Products database are stored 
                        when an admin fills out a form of the product to sell. If the customer wants to sell 
                        their products, they must fill out a form that will be sent to the admin. When a customer orders a 
                        product on our web app, the database needs the customer's ID to create the order.

                    <p> Our project management will follow the agile methodology. Every week we will have a one-hour
                        scrum meeting (every Tuesday at 8 pm) to talk about what we have done the previous week and
                        what we are going to do for the following week. Besides that, we divide the project into
                        modules, thus every week we will have something to deliver. The distribution of the modules
                        throughout the semester will be as follows:
                        <li> Week1 (10/12 – 10/17) - Finish “About Us” tab (proposal and pitch) </li>
                        <li> Week2 (10/19 – 10/24) - Research and design details for layouts and features </li>
                        <li> Week3 (10/26 – 10/31) - Create products listing page:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Front-end: Create the UI based on the layouts agreed on </li>
