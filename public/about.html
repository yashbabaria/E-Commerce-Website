                    <p> Our mission is to construct a website that offers several products with style and ease to help with the 
                        current COVID-19 pandemic. With the current pandemic, there has been a limited supply of gear and products 
                        that are tailored for fashion and have limited fashion and aesthetic appeal. For example, all the PPP blue 
                        masks might not look great on an individual’s outfit, or it looks out of match for the color pattern they 
                        are wearing. With our website, we aim to extend the reach of products that are aimed to product individuals 
                        from COVID as well as look and feel aesthetically pleasing to the customer. This page is a collective of 
                        products and services that are tailored for COVID, as well as make the customer want to keep showing off 
                        their newest gear to their friends and family. We aim to deliver all our important products for all age 
                        groups, so that everyone can be a part of the fun. From masks, to face shields, to hand sanitizer, everything 
                        is crafted from the most high quality material in the market. High quality products at an affordable price, is 
                        what we aim to achieve with our webpage, and with easy accessibility as well. The user will be able to see from 
                        the moment they enter the homepage where they can go and buy their essential COVID items, and at what cost and 
                        deals they can obtain. Our page brings the stress of Covid pandemic to a halt, which can help boost usage of the 
                        website. <br><br>
                        As this project is a final project for our CPI310 Web-Based Information Management System class in Arizona State 
                        University, we are planning to finish it by the end of Fall2020 semester, or within seven weeks. The deliverables 
                        of this project will include back-end and front-end elements of the website that allow users to do a full transaction 
                        on our website. Finally, our team is composed of four informative students and one digital culture student where we 
                        will divide our roles as front-end developers, back-end developers, a database administrator, and a project manager.

                    <p> 
                        The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce website that provides a platform for people 
                        to buy and sell COVID essentials easily. Since 2020 has been a tough year for people, Our team wants 
                        to bring safety and style at the same time. Our project wants to have the people walking in style 
                        but keeping themselves and others safe. It is a type of motivation to have people show off their looks
                        and bring a sense of care in this world. There is a sense of bringing things to life such as the health 
                        of elders and encouraging them. The brand of Co-Vidly Safe is to share a community where the target market 
                        is everyone. Saftey and social distancing is critical during a pandemic. The enthusiasm of life 
                        itself has those different values of temperature. Our project wants people to bring on their sense 
                        of being part of a community. Where the temperature is high, medium, and low, a community of 
                        people encouraging others is awesome.

                    <h3> List of Deliverables </h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Front-End:</b> The User Interface is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, and Bootstrap. 	
                        We decided to use the React framework to help us in organizing the modules and components on the 
                        website. Besides that, we are using jQuery and Bootstrap to help us in creating the design effectively and 
                        efficiently. By using Bootstrap, we can save time to create more components on our website while 
                        making sure our design can provide a good user experience. Some pages that will be in the deliverables 
                        are:

                        <b>Back-End:</b> We are using Node JS, Express JS, and SQLite to create the back-end side of the web 
                        application. Node JS and Express JS improves the scalability and the performance, while SQLite provides 
                        a fast and reliable data service for our application. Functionalities that will be included in the 
                        service side are:

                     <h3>Use Case analysis</h3>
                     <p>
                       <img src="assets/imgs/usecase.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Use Case Diagram">
                        Our use case diagram utilizes a relationship between the customer and admin which is the employee.
                        Since, we encourage customers to sell their own products such as masks, health kits, clothes, and 
                        other products that provide a safe environment. The customer role is to be a part of the system 
                        which is to buy products or sell their own products. The admin will sell company products and manage 
                        the customer’s products.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                        The customer can sell a product but must go through an admin.
                        The customer fill out a form and gives an amount of time the product can be shipped.
                        The admin will decide if the customer’s product is considered a Co-Vid safe product.
                        If the admin deems to be not a product that fits the website goal, then the admin will send a 
                        message to the customer saying, “This product is not Co-Vidly Safe”.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        When the customer is shopping, they can add products to their cart and delete products in their cart.
                        When the customer is done shopping, then they can click on the cart icon and review the products in 
                        their cart. Then they can click on proceed to checkout and start purchasing the products.
                        The customer will choose how to pay for their products by electronically paying for the products.
                        They can pay by PayPal, add a credit card or debit card information, or others that involve their bank.
                        The admin will set the shipping tax and date when adding a product.
                        When the customer goes through the checkout process, then the products will be shipped to their address.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Database Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/imgs/datadesign.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Herlina Widodo">
                        The database design is pretty simple for an e-commerce website.
                        The website needs to record the Customers, Products, Orders, and Order Details.
                        From the customer, what is stored is the full name, date of birth,  location, email, username, 
                        and password. This is by creating an ID for that customer to purchase or sell products on this website.
                        The customer will be in our database when they register for the website. The products will be stored 
                        when an admin fills in a form that will be linked to our database. The admin also needs to input how 
                        much of the product there is in the warehouse and suggest a discount. If the customer wants to sell 
                        their products, they must fill out a form that will be sent to the admin. When a customer orders a 
                        product on our website, the database needs an ID to create an order which will have a shipping date 
                        for our admin’s to see.

                    <p> Our project management will follow the agile methodology. Every week we will have a one-hour
                        scrum meeting (every Tuesday at 8 pm) to talk about what we have done the previous week and
                        what we are going to do for the following week. Besides that, we divide the project into
                        modules, thus every week we will have something to deliver. The distribution of the modules
                        throughout the semester will be as follows:
                        <li> Week1 (10/12 – 10/17) - Finish “About Us” tab (proposal and pitch) </li>
                        <li> Week2 (10/19 – 10/24) - Research and design details for layouts and features </li>
                        <li> Week3 (10/26 – 10/31) - Create products listing page:
